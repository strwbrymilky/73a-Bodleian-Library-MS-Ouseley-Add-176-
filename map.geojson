    "description":"\"The Shahnama, also known as the ‘Book of Kings,’ is an epic poem written by Persian poet Firdausi in the early eleventh century (Firouzeh 2019, 49). The poem’s great popularity resulted in many copies being made over the years, with one of these copies being the Shahnama of Ibrahim Sultan, which is the manuscript that our folio of focus comes from. The Shahnama of Ibrahim Sultan was created around 1420-1440 CE. The first copy of the Shahnama was written by Firdausi over a span of thirty years, during which three distinct periods can be distinguished: the mythological, heroic, and historical periods (Pourmokhtar & Afshari 2018, 347). The story of the legendary Persian hero Rustam takes place during the heroic period (Pourmokhtar & Afshari 2018, 347).  This folio captures the moment immediately after the sorcerer king of Mazandaran has turned himself into a rock as an attempt to evade death at the hands of the great warrior Rustam. Up to this point, Rustam has completed the seven courses and freed Kay Kaus from the evil divs of Mazandaran.  Now that we know some history behind the Shahnama, allow us to begin this chapter of Rustam’s story.  When Rustam left, the king of sorcerers Prepared for war, brought out his tent-enclosure, And led the whole host forth upon the waste ; Their dust hid sun and desert, plain and mountain, While earth reeled 'neath the tramp of elephants. He marched like rushing wind. Kaus on hearing, ' The di'vs' host is in sight,' first ordered Rustam To arm for fight and then to Tus, Giidarz, Son of Kishwad, and to Gurgm and Giv, Those men of noble lineage, he gave The arraying of the host, the ordering Of spear and shield. \" (Firdausi 1906, 70)"},

Dry and his assistants, and the faithfulness and accuracy with which this work has been done an examination of the pages will attest. Absolute truth and accuracy in the representation of the territory has been the standard and in no cases have additions or alterations been made unless the same were actually in course of construction. In a few cases, important public and private edifices that are not yet finished are shown completed, and as they will appear when done. All the buildings within the limits of the survey in July, 1875, are shown; and a very large number of those executed or commenced since that date have been also introduced, the pages having been constantly corrected up to the last possible moment before publication.\""},
