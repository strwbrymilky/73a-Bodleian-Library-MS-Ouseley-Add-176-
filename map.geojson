    "description":"The Shahnama, also known as the ‘Book of Kings,’ is an epic poem written by Persian poet Firdausi in the early eleventh century (Firouzeh 2019, 49). The poem’s great popularity resulted in many copies being made over the years, with one of these copies being the Shahnama of Ibrahim Sultan, which is the manuscript that our folio of focus comes from. The Shahnama of Ibrahim Sultan was created around 1420-1440 CE. The first copy of the Shahnama was written by Firdausi over a span of thirty years, during which three distinct periods can be distinguished: the mythological, heroic, and historical periods (Pourmokhtar & Afshari 2018, 347). The story of the legendary Persian hero Rustam takes place during the heroic period (Pourmokhtar & Afshari 2018, 347).\n\n This folio illustration captures the moment immediately after the sorcerer king of Mazandaran has turned himself into a rock as an attempt to evade death at the hands of the great warrior Rustam. Up to this point, Rustam has completed the seven courses and freed Kay Kaus from the evil divs of Mazandaran. Now that we know some history behind the Shahnama and context behind the folio, allow us to begin this chapter of Rustam’s story:\n\n “When Rustam left, the king of sorcerers Prepared for war, brought out his tent-enclosure, And led the whole host forth upon the waste ; Their dust hid sun and desert, plain and mountain, While earth reeled 'neath the tramp of elephants. He marched like rushing wind. Kaus on hearing, ' The di'vs' host is in sight,' first ordered Rustam To arm for fight and then to Tus, Giidarz, Son of Kishwad, and to Gurgm and Giv, Those men of noble lineage, he gave The arraying of the host, the ordering Of spear and shield” (Firdausi 1906, 70).\n\n “When Rustam heard he raised his battle-cry, Proclaimed his name, and as he charged appeared A moving mountain, while his foe dismayed Wheeled round unwilling to contend with him, But Rustam following, swift as dust, and aiming The spearpoint straight against the girdlestead, So speared the mail that straps and buckles burst, Unseated him, raised him aloft, and turned him Like bird on spit, then flung him down dust-choked, With shivered mail” (Firdausi 1906, 72).\n\n These details about our hero from the text do not seem to translate over to the illustration in the folio. The curious expression on Rustam’s face and his straight posture seated atop Rakhsh suggests that he is alert and intrigued rather than a vengeful warrior. The folio depicts Rustam’s reaction after witnessing the sorcerer king transform himself into stone. Rather than displaying Rustam’s warrior appearance and skills, the artist has chosen to fully embody the pause in thought that Rustam must have had as he “stood in amaze” (Firdausi 1906, 74) after seeing the king’s magic with his own eyes."},

    "description":"Rustam is the great hero of the Shahnama, and Firdausi takes extra care to include details of Rustam’s appearance and fighting prowess to set him apart from all others in the epic poem (Piera 2018, 118). During the battle between Kay Kaus and the divs of Mazandaran, Rustam’s greatness is exemplified in the descriptions of his battle cries, appearance, and combat skills, using descriptors such as “elephantine,” “moving mountain,” and “matchless” (Firdausi 1906, 70-4). Here are two sections from the battle in Mazandaran that capture Rustam’s strength in battle:\n\n “Rustam urged His gallant Rakhsh and grasped his weighty spear, Came on the scene like some mad elephant, A Pard beneath him and in hand a Dragon, Sent dust-clouds flying as he wheeled about, And shouting shook the battle-field. ' O knave ! ' He cried, ' thy name is cancelled 'mong the great. This is no time of peace and ease for thee, But pity ; she shall weep who bare thee, nurtured, And chastened thee'’ (Firdausi 1906, 71)."},

    "description":"Rustam’s trusted companion and steed Rakhsh has been with our hero for much of his journey. Miraculously, Rakhsh exhibits the same level of power as his rider and is the only horse that has ever been able to withstand Rustam’s heavy body and immense power (Piera 2018, 118). Rakhsh and Rustam are kindred spirits, as they both share the same fierceness and hunger for battle. Because of the shared traits between our hero and his horse, Rakhsh can be viewed as a reflection of Rustam’s character and inner thoughts (Piera 2018, 118).\n\n In the folio illustration, Rakhsh is drawn with good posture, standing straight and tall above the enemy horse facing him. He wears sturdy armour, showing that he is a horse meant for the battlefield. His front leg is lifted and ready to stomp or kick his enemy. Looking closer at the horse’s face, we can see that Rakhsh is actually biting the enemy horse that has already turned to stone. Keeping in mind how Rakhsh is a reflection of Rustam (Piera 2018, 118) and how Rustam is illustrated in the folio image, we can interpret Rakhsh as a representation of Rustam’s many characteristics that are not represented in the image. Rustam is still, intrigued, and curious, while Rakhsh displays movement by biting and lifting his leg. This illustration of Rakhsh is a mirror image of Rustam’s own inner fury and power."},

    "description":"The king of Mazandaran is the leader of the evil demons known as divs. He is also referred to in the Shahnama as the king of sorcerers, which we know to be true as his sorcery is at the centre of the folio. During the battle in Mazandaran, the king himself seems to lead his army of divs and elephants well, commanding the warriors and giving them the vengeful courage to fight even when they are frozen with fear at the sight of our mighty hero Rustam (Firdausi 1906, 72). Although the monarch inspires and leads his army in battle, his use of sorcery in the moment he faces death may contradict his courageous and fierce front. It is here in the story that we finally reach the moment captured in the folio illustration:\n\n “When the king beheld The spear of Rustam wrath and courage failed, While Rustam, seething with revenge, sent up A mighty lion's roar, struck the king's girdle, And pierced him through the mail. The sorcerer Turned to a boulder by his magic arts Before the Iranian host, while matchless Rustam Stood in amaze, then shouldered his sharp lance” (Firdausi 1906, 74).\n\n '' When victorious fortune showed Amid the stress the monarch seeing me Took up his massive mace, I gave to Rakhsh The rein and speared the monarch through the mail. Methought : ' Now will he tumble from his saddle. ' He turned to stone before me, as thou seest, And recketh not of aught that I can do, But I will carry him to camp, perchance He will resume his shape ' (Firdausi 1906, 74).\n\n As I see it, the king’s use of sorcery can be interpreted in two ways. The first is that the king’s use of sorcery to become a virtually unbreakable boulder is a clever use of his power to escape death at the hands of the enemy’s strongest warrior. My second interpretation of his use of sorcery is that transforming himself into stone rather than battling his foe honourably is an act of cowardice. After analyzing how the king is illustrated in the folio, I have come to the conclusion that the artist must have seen the use of sorcery as cleverness rather than cowardice. The posing of both the king and his horse is still and calm, and the rocky textures almost look like flowing water. The image of the sorcerer exudes an energy that is focused, concise, and calculated."},

    "description":"After discussing the characters as the main focus of the folio, we must take some time to look closer at the background and landscape. The battle takes place in the Mazandaran desert. The desert sand takes up much of the folio’s background and is painted in soft waves of sandy beige. Zooming into the finer details allows us to see that the wave-like designs on the ground may be small patches of dry grass sprouting from beneath the sand. Above the ground in the far back are small areas of light blue, which are either patches of sky or water. Returning to the sand, some notable details are the patches of red, white, purple, and orange flowers growing sporadically in the sand. Gardens in Iranian culture represent calmness, safety, and the relationship between humans and nature (Gholipour 2016, 6). Although it is not a garden being depicted in the folio, the artist’s inclusion of flowers may be intended to provide contrast. It is peculiar for flowers representing a sort of serenity and harmony between human and nature to be growing on a battlefield described in the text with such gruesome language and descriptions of death.\n\n “None e'er saw such a fight. Arose the din Of arrow, mace, and sword, the plain became A pool of heroes' blood, earth like a sea Of pitch whose waves were maces, swords, and arrows. Swift steeds sped on like ships upon the deep, And thou hadst said of them : *' They founder fast ! ' While maces rained upon the casques and helms As autumn-blasts shower leaves from willow-trees' (Firdausi 72-3).\n\n “From dawn till sunset Blood ran in streams, all looks were fierce and grim, And thou hadst said : ' The sky is raining maces.' The slain were heaped on every side, the grass Was smirched with human brains. The drums and trumpets Were like a thunder-clap, an ebon veil Concealed the sun” (Firdausi 1906, 73).\n\n By adding flowers to such a scene, the artist’s intentions must have been either to provide contrast between life and death, or simply to add aesthetic beauty to the painting."},

    "description":"Adorned in his gold-colored shawl and red robe boasting a distinctive gold pattern, Ibrahim Sultan is seated comfortably in the middle of a luxurious gold carpet, while everyone must stand together in a tight crowd. He is placed in the centre of the folio so not only is he more prominent that way, but by scattering foliage and other entities like his ministers and musicians, the illustrator tries to slow down the viewer’s eyes while they examine the folio. This is done as a means to build up suspense leading up to the grand reveal, the patron of the manuscript (Hillenbrand 1992, 6). The Sultan wears his own uniquely styled crown, in contrast with everyone else’s turbans.\n\nMoreover, he can be seen sitting under a red parasol which is a unique way of highlighting royalty in Shirazi art from that period. Originally from 14th century paintings of Mongol princes, it quickly became a means for Timurid kings to stress their lineage to Timur and thus bolster their authority (Blair 1996, 2).Examining the posture of Ibrahim Sultan, he is seated cross-legged with one leg resting and the other upright, with his hand extended as he addresses his court. Holding this posture allows him to exude a calm yet intimidating demeanor."},

    "description":"The crockery portrayed is white, covered with designs of blue. These are very likely wine containers for the Sultan’s pleasure. Upon closer inspection, we can make out a dragon-like design on the left container, whilst the one on the right has some sort of creature that bears a resemblance to a peacock. This blue on white porcelain style originated from China and spread with the conquests of the Mongols (Golombek 2001, 5). This design language was quickly adopted by potters in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as they learned to make it themselves by imitating crafts that were imported from the Chinese region. Some craftsmen chose to imitate older imports instead of new ones and in doing so pottery began to be made that had both old and new Chinese elements.\n\nFast forward to the mid-1500s and craftsmen all over the Timurid empire were producing such crockery for both royalty and commonfolk alike. The princes at the time were avid collectors of Chinese porcelain and this trend continued into the Safavid era (Golombek 2001, 5). In this case, we can also see a third container unlike the other two, made of gold, showing Ibrahim Sultan had a diverse taste in the sort of crafts that he collected."},
